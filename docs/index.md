  API Token
  You can generate a Semaphore API token by logging into Semaphore, opening the browser Developer Tools console, and running the following command:
  
  fetch("/api/user/tokens", {

  }).then(res => res.json()).then(data => console.log("api_token = " + data.id));
  
  The token will be printed in the console. This token will grant the same level of access as the logged in user. Copy the token value and use it to configure the provider. The token is sensitive and should be treated as a secret. It is recommended to use the SEMAPHOREUI_API_TOKEN environment variable to configure the provider.

# semaphoreui Provider

Use the SemaphoreUI provider to interact with Semaphore UI via the API. You must configure the provider with the proper credentials before you can use it.

## API Token
You can generate a Semaphore API token by logging into Semaphore, opening the browser Developer Tools console, and running the following command:
```javascript
fetch("/api/user/tokens", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}, 
  body: JSON.stringify({})
}).then(res => res.json()).then(data => console.log("api_token = " + data.id));
```
The token will be printed in the console. This token will grant the same level of access as the logged in user. Copy the token value and use it to configure the provider. The token is sensitive and should be treated as a secret. It is recommended to use the `SEMAPHOREUI_API_TOKEN` environment variable to configure the provider.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Configure the SemaphoreUI provider using required_providers.
terraform {
  required_providers {
    semaphore = {
      source  = "CruGlobal/semaphoreui"
      version = "~> 1.0.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "semaphoreui" {
  hostname  = "example.com"
  port      = 3000   # Default: 3000
  path      = "/api" # Default: "/api"
  protocol  = "http" # Default: "https"
  api_token = "your token"
}
```
