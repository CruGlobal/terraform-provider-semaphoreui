# semaphoreui_project_environment (Resource)

The project environment (variable group) resource allows you to manage a list of extra and environment variables that can be used in a project's templates.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "semaphoreui_project" "project" {
  name = "Example Project"
}

resource "semaphoreui_project_environment" "environment" {
  project_id = semaphoreui_project.project.id
  name       = "Example Environment"

  # extraVars
  variables = {
    key1 = "value1"
    key2 = "value2"
  }

  # environment variables
  environment = {
    KEY1 = "value1"
    KEY2 = "value2"
  }

  # secrets
  secrets = [{
    # extraVar Secret
    name  = "key3"
    type  = "var"
    value = "value3"
    }, {
    # environment Secret
    name  = "KEY4"
    type  = "env"
    value = "value4"
  }]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The display name of the environment.
- `project_id` (Number) (ForceNew) The project ID that the environment belongs to.

### Optional

- `environment` (Map of String) Environment variables.
- `secrets` (Attributes List) Secret variables of either `"var"` or `"env"` type. The `value` is encrypted and will be empty if imported. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--secrets))
- `variables` (Map of String) Extra variables. Passed to Ansible as extra variables (`--extra-vars`) and Terraform/OpenTofu as variables (`-var`).

### Read-Only

- `id` (Number) The environment ID.

<a id="nestedatt--secrets"></a>
### Nested Schema for `secrets`

Required:

- `name` (String) The variable name.
- `type` (String) The variable type. Value must be one of : `env`, `var`.
- `value` (String, Sensitive) The variable value.

Read-Only:

- `id` (Number) The variable ID.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# When semaphoreui_project_environment is imported, the `secrets` values
# will be blank as SemaphoreUI does not return these values on the API.
#
# Import ID is specified by the string "project/{project_id}/environment/{environment_id}".
# - {project_id} is the ID of the project in SemaphoreUI.
# - {environment_id} is the ID of the environment in SemaphoreUI.
terraform import semaphoreui_project_environment.example project/1/environment/2
```
Or using `import {}` block in the configuration file:
```hcl
import {
  to = semaphoreui_project_environment.example
  id = "project/1/environment/2"
}
```
