## Schema

### Required

- `branch` (String) The branch of the repository to use. Use an empty string for path based repositories.
- `name` (String) The display name of the repository.
- `project_id` (Number) The project ID that the repository belongs to.
- `ssh_key_id` (Number) The Project Key ID to use for accessing the Git repository.

This attribute is required for all repositories in SemaphoreUI. You should set it to the ID of a Key of type `none` if the repository doesn't require credentials.
- `url` (String) The URI or path of the Git repository. SemaphoreUI supports `ssh`, `http`, `https`, `file` and `git` URI schemes as well as absolute paths.

### Read-Only

- `id` (Number) The repository ID.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Import ID is specified by the string "project/{project_id}/repository/{repository_id}".
# - {project_id} is the ID of the project in SemaphoreUI.
# - {repository_id} is the ID of the repository in SemaphoreUI.
terraform import semaphoreui_project_repository.example project/1/repository/2
```
Or using `import {}` block in the configuration file:
```hcl
import {
  to = semaphoreui_project_repository.example
  id = "project/1/repository/2"
}
```
